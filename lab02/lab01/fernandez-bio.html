<h1>Sophia Fernandez's Biography</h1>
<p>
I am an ischool student majoring in <strong>Information Management and Technology.</strong> Some interests related to my major is design, marketing, advertising, and the use of social media as well. Last year I was a TA for an IST course and was able to practice my organizational and leadership skills. I have managed multiple social media accounts for organizations and groups on campus and hope to continue this during this semester as well.

<h2>Outside of school I enjoy a variety of different hobbies. I enjoy staying active and doing workout classes throughout the week, and I also spend my free time making jewelry for fun. I also love music and am rarely seen without my airpods in or listening to music on my speaker. There aren’t many genres that I don’t enjoy, and I listen to a broad variety of artists and styles. I have also been a dancer since the age of 2 and am a member of the Syracuse DanceWorks organization, which has been an amazing way to continue my love for dance in college. Being involved on campus and with Syracuse University in general is really important to me, here is a list of some things I'm a part of in Syracuse and some accomplishemnts as well.</h2>
