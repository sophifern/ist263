    <article1><p style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 115%">In high school, when I started to develop my own style, Instagram influencers started to become more popular and common. I remember discovering accounts where girls would share their outfits and being inspired by their posts. By having access to these accounts, I was able to discover more clothing brands that made me happy and fit my ideal style/character. As corny as it sounds, fashion is a form of expression. What you wear can heavily impact how you feel about yourself. To this day, I notice that when I wear clothing that I’m excited to put on, I feel a lot happier and confident about myself. Ever since following those influencer accounts I had wanted to start my own but felt too embarrassed to ever do it.  </p></article1>
    <article2><p style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 115%"> After being sent home from school my freshman year of college due to corona I felt completely discouraged and hopeless. During the quarantine I spent my days in sweatpants and watching tv, letting my mental and physical health go. After countless weeks of doing nothing, I decided I would finally start my fashion account for fun. My intentions with @fernlookbook were never (and still aren’t) to become an influencer. Instead, I created this account simply to share things that made me happy. I started by posting outfits I styled during the quarantine (I would spend my days dressing up and taking photoshoots around my house using the timer camera). I also came up with a concept where every Friday I would feature a friend (“Feature Fridays”) of mine whom I thought had good style and post an album of cool outfits they have worn. This then sparked the idea of “Shout-out Sundays” where I talk about a clothing, jewelry, accessory, or home decor brand that I liked to share with others. This account is something that I still enjoy doing and brings me a lot of happiness. After taking a social media class last year, I learned so much more about how to grow a business, the importance of advertising, and how to keep content cohesive. Something about my account that I love is that it’s genuine and used as a creative outlet.  </p></article2>
