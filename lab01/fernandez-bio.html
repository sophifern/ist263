I am an ischool student majoring in Information Management and Technology. Some interests related to my major is design, marketing, advertising, and the use of social media as well. Last year I was a TA for an IST course and was able to practice my organizational and leadership skills. I have managed multiple social media accounts for organizations and groups on campus and hope to continue this during this semester as well.
Outside of school I enjoy a variety of different hobbies. I enjoy staying active and doing workout classes throughout the week, and I also spend my free time making jewelry for fun. I also love music and am rarely seen without my airpods in or listening to music on my speaker. There aren’t many genres that I don’t enjoy, and I listen to a broad variety of artists and styles.
