        Welcome to fernlookbook on the web! 
        My name is Sophia Fernandez and I’m a junior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology in the ischool. 
        Some interests of mine related to my major are design, marketing, advertising, the use of social media, video editing, and anything related to editing social platforms.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of school I like to stay very busy and be involved in a variety of different things. 
        I enjoy staying active and doing workout classes throughout the week. 
        On campus I am a member of the Syracuse DanceWorks Organization, which has been a great opportunity to continue my passion for dance in college, and I'm a member of the Alpha Chapter of Alpha Phi. 
        In fact, I ran the social media accounts for both of these groups.
        Since a young age I have been interested in fashion and design which has become one of my favorite passions. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Over the spring 2020 quarantine I created an Instagram account called @fernlookbook. 
        It has become a platform where I share the outfits I wear and any items related to fashion. 
        It was something I started for fun and to share with friends, 
        although over time it gained some popularity and even people I don’t know very well have engaged with my account. 
        I want this website to be another space for my love for fashion and style, and expand what my fernlookbook account means to me.
