    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <article1><p>Now that I have had this account for over a year and seen how much it has positively impacted my life; I want to expand and use this platform in more ways.
        <br>
        I always have had friends and people reach out to me for outfit advice especially for an event or special occasion. Recently, because of this account, a lot more people have asked me to help style them, shop for them, and update their wardrobe. I love pairing outfits together and working with clothing, while simultaneously making someone feel happy and confident about what they wear. After realizing how many people appreciate my advice and want me to work with them to help them dress out of their current comfort zone, I thought about making this a service and small start up opportunity. Now that I am a junior living off campus, I was able to decorate my room and apartment more than I could in a dorm. Some friends have also asked for help organizing their decorations and advice on what could be hung on their walls. These interactions inspired me to think about all the possibilities there are.</p></article1>
    <article2><p>I have also started creating jewelry and would be interested in selling the pieces on my account. If that goes well, I can create a section of this website dedicated to my jewelry pieces. Basically, my goal for fernlookbook on the web is to organize all my ideas and projects into one place. 
        <br>
        If you are interested in having me work with you in any way, know of any opportunities that you think I would be interested, want to reach out just because, or have any comments at all, feel free to share! Feedback is super important to me. Getting ideas from others helps with inspiration and also keeps me motivated. 
        <br>
        Give me feedback!
